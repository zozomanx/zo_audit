A Fivem resource for investigative agencies like FIB/CID. Currently set to be controlled via judges (with an approved warrant of course)

If you're looking to track down illegal money transfers or wondering how a certain person always has a large sum of money flowing through them this is the tool for you.

The config lets you customize locations, jobs, and more.

I'm new to creating resources so if something is pants-on-head silly please let me know.
