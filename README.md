A Fivem resource for investigative agencies like FIB/CID, great to be used with a warrant from DOJ. 

If you're looking to track down illegal money transfers or wondering how a certain person always has a large sum of money flowing through them this is the tool for you.

I'm new to creating resources so if something is pants-on-head silly please let me know.
